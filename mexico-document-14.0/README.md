Odoo Mexico Documents (Enterprise).
---

This project is to manage the Mexican documents in Odoo.

# Why a Clean Repository?.

A clean repository is better to add just features that works with Enterprise due to the change of licence it must have and due to the refactor we must do is several features, in order to propose a cleanest solution for 2016 for our biggest customers.

# What will be here as feature?.

We will have 3 kind of modules that must be moved/ported/migrated/done on this repository.

1. Module to manage Mexican documents.
2. Module to manage HR documents.
3. Module to manage Stock documents.

# Licencing of new modules.

All modules will be LGPL-v3 + Vauxoo Exceptions, odoo-lint scripts should manage such revision in order to ensure not include incorrect licencing here.

# Installation.

We need to try to follow [this methodology of design](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Avoid_Preferences.php) proposed by Fabien, avoiding too much preferences, the objective is that all default values should be setted as Data/Data documenting such decisions in the data itself.

# List of features considered.

This titles are only to be considered "Epic Stories", obviously they need huge revision in our expert side and in customer side.

For every one of this features we should link them with a tag in an issue and marked as "Enhancement".

## Functionalities:
